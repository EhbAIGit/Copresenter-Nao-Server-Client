# Copresenter-Nao
 This project features a ChatGPT-powered server designed to generate contextually aware LED eye colors, sentiments, and gestures for the Nao humanoid robot. The server communicates with a client running on Python 2.7, which controls the robot's actions and responses.

Install a conda environment with Python 2.7 for the client.
